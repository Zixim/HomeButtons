## How it works

![How It Works](assets/button_press.gif){width="300", align=left}

**Always forgetting which button triggers which automation?**

With *Home Buttons* you can assign a short label to each button.

The device uses an e-paper display, which enables the labels to be shown permanently, without consuming any power.

The labels can be easily changed using a web interface. You define what happens when a button is pressed directly in *Home Assistant*.
