We recomend that you use Home Buttons as is. Do not do any of the modifications, unless you have experience soldering and working with electronics and know exactly what you are doing. Modifying battery powered devices is dangerous and can result in equipment damage, injury and fire . USB power without battery Home Buttons HW rev 2.1 (visible on the PCB under the Home Buttons text) is designed to be used only when the battery is inserted. We have received some feedback that operation on USB power alone would be nice to have. This will be addressed in future HW revisions, but for HW rev 2.1 , a simple hardware hack can be made. After doing this modification, battery use will no longer be possible! Unmount Home Buttons from the wall and remove the battery. Remove the PCB from the case by flexing the top wall of the case outwards and lightly pressing on the top part of the display, so that the PCB pops out at the top. Place the PCB display side down and take a look at the bottom right corner. This is the area we are going to modify. First, cut the trace connecting a solder jumper marked below. Confirm with a multimeter that there is no connection between the two jumper pads. This disconnects the battery holder from the circuit, so even if the battery is accidentally inserted, nothing bad happens. If desired, you can also de-solder the battery holder completely instead of cutting the jumper. Next, solder a short piece of wire between the inner contact of the two capacitors, as marked below. Use a wire that is very thin and flexible. Connect your USB power supply and test if device works correctly. Place the PCB back into the case by first inserting the bottom part at an angle and then pushing the top part in until it snaps in place. The device are now ready to be used without battery. If you wish to revert this hack, remove the added wire and bridge the jumper with a solder blob.","title":"Hardware Hacks"},{"location":"hardware_hacks/#diy-hardware-hacks","text":"WARNING: Dangerous!

You will need: One 18650 Li-Ion battery cell (not included) A flat headed screwdriver 2x mounting screws with anchors suitable for your walls or double sided tape (must stick to plastic well) A Wi-Fi network An MQTT broker Home Assistant (optional - can work only through MQTT) Insert The Battery You will need one 18650 Li-Ion battery cell ( not included ). Please use a high quality cell with greater than 3000 mAh capacity. Detach the back cover by inserting a flat headed screwdriver in the hole at the bottom and twisting it. Then pull it off. Insert the battery cell. Be careful to orient it so that polarity matches markings on the PCB. Keep the back cover off for now. You will install it when mounting Home Buttons to the wall. Set Up Wi-Fi Connection After inserting the battery, press any button to wake the device and start Wi-Fi setup procedure. If the device doesn't wake when pressing a button, please briefly connect it to an USB-C charger If you don't complete the setup in 10 minutes, Home Buttons will turn off again to save battery. Press any button to wake the device and start again. Home Buttons establishes a Wi-Fi hotspot for configuration. Connect to it by scanning the QR code on the display or manually connecting to Wi-Fi network and entering the password. After connecting to Home Buttons Wi-Fi with your device, a captive portal will pop up automatically. If it doesn't, open the web browser and navigate to any web page. You will be redirected to the captive portal. Click on Configure WiFi and wait a few seconds for a list of networks to appear. Select your network, enter the password and click Save . Home Buttons will disable the hotspot and connect to your Wi-Fi network in a few seconds. Wi-Fi CONNECTED will appear on display. If connection is not successful, Wi-Fi error will be displayed and Home Buttons will return to welcome screen. You can start Wi-Fi setup again by pressing any button. Please make sure to enter the password correctly. Set Up MQTT Broker Home Buttons requires an MQTT broker. If you don't already use it, you should install one now. See this page for more information. Usually, the simplest way is to install Mosquitto MQTT as a Home Assistant add-on. Set Up MQTT connection & Button Labels When connected to your Wi-Fi network, Home Buttons can be configured using any device on your local network. Scan the QR code or enter the local IP into a web browser. The setup page will load: Click Setup Enter the connection parameters: Device Name - Name of your device as it will appear in Home Assistant . MQTT Server - IP address of your MQTT broker. Usually the same as IP of your Home Assistant server. MQTT Port - Port used by MQTT broker. The default is usually 1883 . MQTT User - MQTT user name (can be empty if not required by broker). MQTT Password - MQTT password (can be empty if not required by broker). Base Topic - MQTT topic that will be prepended to all topics used by Home Buttons . The default is homebuttons .

Enter button labels Button 1 Label - Button 6 Label - Label that will be displayed next to each button. The order is from top to bottom. Home Buttons will choose font size automatically. It can display around 5 letters in large font and around 7 letters in smaller font. Labels over 7 letters will be clipped. Choose what you want to display wisely :) Confirm by clicking Save . Device will exit the setup and display button labels. If MQTT connection is not successful, MQTT error will be displayed and Home Buttons will return to welcome screen. You can start the setup again by pressing any button. Please make sure to enter correct MQTT parameters. Set Up Home Assistant Home Buttons uses MQTT Discovery and will appear in Home Assistant 's device list automatically. There you can see device information, sensor readings, battery state and set up button actions. To set up button actions, click \"+\" on Automations card, select one of the buttons and set up an automation with Home Assistant 's editor. Mount To The Wall Mount the back cover of Home Buttons to the wall. There are 2 options: Screws Use two screws (max diameter 4.5 mm) with anchors suitable for your walls (not included). Tape Use double sided tape (not included). Use only high quality heavy duty foam mounting tape. A small patch of size around 1 x 1 cm in each corner works best. Either way, make sure the arrow is pointing upwards! When the back cover is securely mounted, you can clip on the front of the device. Push it firmly until it's flush with the wall. DONE! Other Important Information Charging The expected battery life is > 1.5 years with a high quality 18650 cell. When the battery is getting low, Home Buttons will remind you to charge after pressing a button. If the battery gets critically low, the device will turn off. The display will show: TURNED OFF PLEASE RECHARGE BATTERY . You can see the remaining batter percentage as a sensor in Home Assistant . Plug in any USB-C charger to charge the battery. The expected full charge time is 4 hours. There is no state of charge indication during charging. When the battery is fully charged, the display will show FULLY CHARGED . Temperature & Humidity Home Buttons includes a high precision temperature and humidity sensor. The readings are taken every 10 minutes and on every button press. The values are displayed as sensors in Home Assistant . You can bring up a display of current temperature, humidity & battery charge percentage by pressing any button for 2 seconds. The device will automatically revert to showing button labels in 30 seconds. Or do that manually by pressing any button again. What's next?
